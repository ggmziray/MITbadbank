## Description

Bad Bank is one of the Capstone Projects for MIT - Masters Fullstack Development course with MERN. This app presents a fictional bank without security (hence, Bad Bank) and incorporates concepts such as hooks, context, routing, and form validations.

## Features

* Create an account (as many as desired for this demo)
* Deposit money into last created account (last created for demo)
* Withdraw money into last created account (last created for demo)
* View all account data (minus balance as this was not a requirement)

Note: For simplicity, this app uses [React Context](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html) to maintain account information.
